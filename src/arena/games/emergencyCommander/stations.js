/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 *  GAME 5 — EMERGENCY RESPONSE COMMANDER
 *  Command stations
 *
 *  The response is COMMANDED BY DOING, not by picking from a list. Each
 *  of the eight ICS steps is a real object somewhere on the site that
 *  the player has to find and act on:
 *
 *      raise the alarm   →  the break-glass call point on the hut
 *      isolate           →  the site intake panel by the compound gate
 *      evacuate          →  the muster point marker
 *      cordon            →  cones you place yourself around the incident
 *      casualty          →  the first-aid post, NOT the casualty
 *      call 999          →  the radio at the command post
 *      meet the services →  the site gate
 *      hand over         →  the command post board
 *
 *  Order matters, because it is the order that saves people. Acting out
 *  of sequence still works but costs scene control; the one thing that
 *  is always wrong is walking into the hazard yourself, and that is
 *  available as a clickable object precisely so it can be refused.
 *
 *  Pure data — no THREE — so the response plan can be reviewed without
 *  reading any 3D code.
